"New Providence" will be a server for hosting peer-to-peer shared videos and music between people in my friend group. The general idea is a server hosted at one of our houses, running a custom program for accessing the files and downloading them to each user's personal computer. The program will be originally available only on Windows, but may eventually be on Linux and MacOS as well. Each user must have a username and password, and when logging in, their IP will be checked against previous IPs for location data to make sure we know all people accessing the server and that the usernames aren't shared. Anyone attempting to let someone else in can request them a username and password, so long as the person comes recommended by a primary user.

The file transfers will use my custom groundfish256 encryption to prevent any knowledge of what is being transferred from leaking to an ISP. The groundfish256 "word" list will be updated weekly by the server, and anyone logging in with an old list will automatically update to the new list (which will be encrypted using their current list format to prevent the lists being leaked). Users will not have to know how groundfish256 works to use the program. They can just log in, see a list of what is available, and iterate through the folders to find what they want.

The program will check for a list of what they already have in the program folder, and mark it as downloaded. If there is an update to any existing files, the user will be notified and ask if they want to update that file (for example, if a higher kbps MP3 is found and replaced on the server, it might ask them if they want the update. The message will include the update log so they know what's being updated and why. Any files they don't have will be able to be selected and queued up, and the downloads will happen in the background as they continue looking through the server. There will be a progress bar along the bottom of the screen showing per-file progress, as well as a counter for how many files are remaining to be downloaded, and how many megabytes are remaining in that collection to be synced.

The general idea is that any of our friends can share music and movies amongst each other, without having to worry about alerting ISPs. Only one person will need to torrent a program, and everyone else can get it through New Providence once they sync it to the server. Anything uploaded will be able to be tagged, and people can put in tags they get notifications for when they log in. For example, I could add a tag notification for "Westworld" and if someone uploads Westworld and tags it, the program will inform me of this when I next log in. In addition, people can put up requests on a temporary message board and others can view the message board for requests and attempt to fulfill them.

Development Steps To Do:

- Add in a system for automatic updating of the groundfish256 word list. Users should be able to specify their word list version number when they start up, and the server should accept their login information in that word list version, then update them to the latest after their login is confirmed. The new list should arrive, encrypted using the old list. This can also be visualized if it takes more than a half-second on the client. (It can be visualized using a 256-partition circle that gets colored in as the messages arrive?)

- Add hovering support in Arcadia Engine UI, to make buttons easier to spot

- Add user uploads, centered around a folder users can put files into, then check them off in the program, and give a name and title to, as well as tagging before uploading.
